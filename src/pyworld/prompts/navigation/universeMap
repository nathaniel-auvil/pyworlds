The game universe is broken into multiple regions.
    each region has differing levels of resources and threats. Initally the threats take the form of 
    pirates which are non aligned fleets looking to steal your resources and cosmic anomalies which are 
    unexplained random events which cause failures and even loss of ships and fleets.

A region contains many star systems and a players claim includes multiple star systems.  

Travel from a space station to a region requires fuel. Fuel can be purchased from a space station.

Players start the game with access to one region.  They will need to be able to travel back and forth from the region
to gather from their claim.

Travel to regions takes time.  The first region should be a relatively short trip with higher levels
regions taking more travel time.

Once a fleet arrives at a region :
    player is presented a list of all the claims you have in the region
    a claim will span one more more star systems
    player will first have to probe a star system to see what resources are available
    star systems are composed of one star, one to many planets and  zero to one asteroid belts, 
    a planet may be solid or a gas giant
    a planet may have have zero or one moons.

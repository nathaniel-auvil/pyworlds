# Mining Gameplay Features

## Active Mining Mini-Game

The mining mini-game allows players to actively collect resources rather than just waiting for passive collection. This adds an interactive element to resource gathering and rewards player skill and engagement.

### Current Implementation

- Players can launch the mini-game from the Overview tab by selecting a fleet and clicking "Start Mining"
- The game presents a space field with asteroids of different types (metal, gas, energy)
- Players click on asteroids to mine them, with larger asteroids providing more resources
- The game runs for 60 seconds, after which all collected resources are added to the fleet's storage
- Different colored asteroids represent different resource types:
  - Gray: Metal
  - Light Blue: Gas
  - Yellow: Energy

### Future Enhancements

- Add difficulty levels that scale with the region's level
- Implement special rare asteroids with valuable resources
- Add obstacles or hazards that players need to avoid
- Include power-ups that temporarily increase mining efficiency
- Create upgradeable mining tools that affect the mini-game mechanics
- Add a high score system to encourage replaying

## Resource Processing

Future idea: Add a processing mini-game where raw resources can be refined into more valuable materials.

- Raw metal can be processed into refined metal (2:1 ratio but higher value)
- Raw gas can be processed into refined gas (3:1 ratio but higher value)
- Processing could require energy and time
- Could include a mini-game similar to the mining game but with different mechanics

## Trading System

Future idea: Implement a trading system where players can buy and sell resources at different prices based on region.

- Each region has different market prices for resources
- Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand
- Players can make profit by buying low in one region and selling high in another
- Special trade missions with time limits and bonus rewards

## Combat System

Future idea: Add a combat system for defending against pirates or competing with other corporations.

- Turn-based or real-time combat mini-game
- Ships can be equipped with different weapons and defenses
- Successful combat yields salvage resources and experience
- Fleet upgrades can improve combat capabilities

# Universe Exploration Features

## Star System Exploration

Building on the existing region system, each region could contain multiple star systems that players can explore.

### Star System Components

- **Stars**: Central to each system, different types (red dwarf, yellow, blue giant) affect nearby planets
- **Planets**: Various types (rocky, gas giant, ice) with different resource distributions
- **Moons**: Smaller bodies orbiting planets, often with unique resources
- **Asteroid Belts**: Rich in minerals and metals, ideal for mining operations
- **Space Anomalies**: Mysterious phenomena that can provide research opportunities or hazards

### Exploration Mechanics

- **Scanning**: Initial scans reveal basic information about a system
- **Probes**: Send probes to gather detailed information about specific celestial bodies
- **Survey Missions**: Detailed analysis of a planet or asteroid belt to find optimal mining locations
- **Claim Staking**: Process to establish mining rights in a promising location

## Discovery System

A system to reward exploration and discovery of new celestial bodies and phenomena.

- **First Discovery Bonuses**: Credits and reputation for being the first to discover a celestial body
- **Naming Rights**: Allow players to name newly discovered planets, moons, or asteroids
- **Scientific Research**: Opportunity to study unique phenomena for technology advancements
- **Cartography**: Mapping star systems provides navigation bonuses and can be sold to other players

## Procedural Generation

Ideas for generating a vast, diverse universe for players to explore.

- **Procedural Star Systems**: Algorithm-generated systems with realistic astronomical properties
- **Resource Distribution**: Natural distribution of resources based on celestial body type
- **Unique Features**: Rare phenomena like binary stars, ringed planets, or resource-rich asteroid clusters
- **Difficulty Scaling**: More distant systems have better resources but more hazards

## Exploration Equipment

Special equipment that aids in exploration and discovery.

- **Advanced Scanners**: Improve range and detail of system scans
- **Long-Range Probes**: Can be sent to distant systems before committing to travel there
- **Survey Drones**: Automated exploration of planets and asteroids
- **Research Modules**: Specialized equipment for studying anomalies and unique phenomena

## Exploration Progression

How exploration capabilities evolve throughout the game.

- **Starting Capabilities**: Limited range and basic scanning equipment
- **Mid-Game**: Improved scanners, ability to send probes to neighboring systems
- **Late-Game**: Long-range exploration, advanced analysis capabilities, specialized exploration vessels

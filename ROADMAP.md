# PyWorlds Development Roadmap

## Current Status
The game is transitioning from a planetary-based economy to a fleet-based system centered around a mothership. Core systems for ship management, resource collection, and space station interaction are being implemented.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Systems Redesign
- [x] Basic Mothership Implementation
- [x] Resource System Foundation
- [x] Module System Base
- [ ] **Mothership Core System**
  - [ ] Update GameState to center around mothership
  - [ ] Implement basic mothership movement
  - [ ] Add mothership health/shield systems
  - [ ] Create basic resource storage system

- [ ] **Resource System Overhaul**
  - [ ] Add new resources (metal, gas, energy, refined materials)
  - [ ] Implement resource collection from space
  - [ ] Create resource refinement system
  - [ ] Add resource storage limits per type

- [ ] **Module System Enhancement**
  - [ ] Create base Module class
  - [ ] Implement different module types (collectors, storage, production)
  - [ ] Add module power requirements
  - [ ] Add module crew requirements
  - [ ] Implement module activation/deactivation

### Phase 2: Fleet Management
- [ ] **Fleet System Core**
  - [ ] Add support ships system
  - [ ] Implement ship construction
  - [ ] Create ship assignment system
  - [ ] Add fleet movement controls

- [ ] **Crew Management**
  - [ ] Add crew hiring system
  - [ ] Implement crew assignment to modules
  - [ ] Add crew skills and experience
  - [ ] Create crew training system

### Phase 3: Space Station Features
- [ ] **Trading System**
  - [ ] Dynamic pricing system
  - [ ] Resource buy/sell interface
  - [ ] Trade volume limits
  - [ ] Price fluctuation based on supply/demand

- [ ] **Mission System**
  - [ ] Add mission generation
  - [ ] Create reward system
  - [ ] Implement mission time limits
  - [ ] Add mission difficulty progression

- [ ] **Blueprint System**
  - [ ] Add blueprint discovery
  - [ ] Create blueprint research system
  - [ ] Implement blueprint requirements
  - [ ] Add blueprint trading

### Phase 4: Space Environment
- [ ] **Space Navigation**
  - [ ] Add coordinate system
  - [ ] Implement movement costs
  - [ ] Create navigation interface
  - [ ] Add speed/distance calculations

- [ ] **Resource Locations**
  - [ ] Add resource fields
  - [ ] Implement resource depletion
  - [ ] Create resource regeneration
  - [ ] Add resource quality variations

- [ ] **Random Events**
  - [ ] Add space anomalies
  - [ ] Implement space hazards
  - [ ] Create emergency events
  - [ ] Add event rewards/consequences

## Future Considerations
- Multiplayer support
- Advanced AI for NPCs
- Dynamic economy system
- Faction system
- Advanced combat mechanics

## Contributing
